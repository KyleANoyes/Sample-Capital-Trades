# Sample-Capital-Trades
Sample code from my algorithmic trading bot (database management and interpretation)

This file is my database management tool designed to organize all recorded stock records into various CSV files in a way that's easy for my program to recall when analyzing a memebers stock trade. This standardizes and sanitizes all my data before it's commited into each members profile. Included are three CSV files showing a sample of how this program has saved over 30,000 other similar entries.

The full program source code will not be relased, but I will show a walk through of my entire program per request
