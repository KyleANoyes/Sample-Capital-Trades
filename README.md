# Sample-Capital-Trades

Sample code from my algorithmic trading bot (database management and sanitization). Had some interesting results and was a fun test of utilizing webscrappers like Selenium.

Should be re-written to optimize performance and take advantage of OOP, however it still functions and was an awesome learning bed for other applications I work on!
