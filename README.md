# Sample-Capital-Trades

Sample code from my algorithmic trading bot (database management and sanitization)

This file is my database management tool designed to organize all recorded stock records into various CSV files in a way that's easy for my program to recall when analyzing a member’s stock trade. This standardizes and sanitizes all my data before it's committed into each member’s profile. Included are three CSV files showing a sample of how this program has saved over 30,000 other similar entries.
